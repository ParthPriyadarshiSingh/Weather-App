# Weather App

This is a React Native project is built using Expo. This app has a home screen which shows weather data based on the user location. I have also implemented search functionality so that user can search weather data for any city in the world. I am using React Native Reanimated to make the UI visually appealing with animations. I am using this [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to fetch data.
